    Convert a raw CSV header into the snake_case column name used by the

        "#1"  -> "qty_1"   (recipes.csv material quantity columns)

    (e.g. "Where/How" -> "where_how"), and any run of characters that
    are not a lowercase letter, digit, or underscore becomes a single
    underscore.

    Examples:
        "Where/How"          -> "where_how"
